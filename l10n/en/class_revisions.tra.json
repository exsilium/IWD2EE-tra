When this power is invoked, the cleric channels positive or negative energy, which has various effects on undead. The higher the cleric's level and charisma are, the greater his or her chance of success is. If the cleric is good, or a neutral follower of a non-evil deity, their turning causes undead to flee, or destroys them outright if the turn undead roll is high enough. If the cleric is evil, or a neutral follower of an evil deity, their turning causes hostile undead to cower before them, or takes control of the undead if the turn undead roll is high enough, while allied undead are instead bolstered, making them more difficult for enemy clerics to turn.

Whenever a monk makes a successful Reflex save against an area effect spell that allows a reflex save for half damage, he or she takes no damage.\n* 2nd level: Deflect Arrows. The monk gains the Deflect Arrows feat, yielding a +1 miscellanous bonus against missile weapons. In addition, the monk automatically blocks the first instance of missile damage that would hit them each round. The monk must have a hand free to block missiles this way.\n* 3rd level: Fast Movement. The monk moves 10 feet faster than a normal character (normal movement speed is 30 feet), but only as long as the monk is not encumbered or wearing armor. The monk gains another 10 feet of movement every 3 levels thereafter.\n* 3rd level: Still Mind. The monk gains a +2 bonus to saving throws against spells and effects from the Enchantment school.\n* 5th level: Purity of Body. The monk gains control over their body's immune system. They gain immunity to all diseases.\n* 7th level: Wholeness of Body. The monk can regain hit points equal to their monk level times their Wisdom modifier once each day per seven levels.\n* 9th level: Improved Evasion. The monk gains the Improved Evasion feat that is normally only available to rogues.\n* 10th level: Abundant Step. The monk may teleport to any location in sight once per day.\n* 11th level: Diamond Body. The monk is in such control of their own metabolism that they gain immunity to poison of all kinds.\n* 13th level: Diamond Soul. The monk gains spell resistance. Their spell resistance equals their level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must roll the monk's spell resistance or higher on 1d20 + the spellcaster's level.\n* 15th level: Quivering Palm. This terrifying attack allows the monk to set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can be fatal. The next time the monk hits a creature with an unarmed attack, the target dies unless it makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + Wisdom modifier + half the monk's level). Constructs and undead cannot be affected. The monk gains an additional use of Quivering Palm every six levels thereafter.\n* 19th level: Empty Body. The monk can assume an incorporeal state for 5 rounds a number of times a day equal to their level divided by 2. While incorporeal, the monk can move through walls, and half the attacks that hit the monk deal no physical damage. The monk's unarmed attacks will ignore armor and shield bonuses.\n* 20th level: Perfect Self. The monk has tuned their body with skill and quasi-magical abilities to the point that they become a magical creature. They are forevermore treated as an outsider (extraplanar creature) rather than as a humanoid. For instance, charm person does not affect them. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 20/+1. This means that the monk ignores (instantly regenerates) the first 20 points of damage from any attack unless the damage is dealt by a weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus (or better), by a spell, or by a form of energy (fire, cold, etc.). As an outsider, a 20th level monk is subject to spells that repel enchanted creatures, such as protection from law.\nDisadvantages:\n* Loses many bonuses if wearing armor and/or using weapons.",

  "537": "PALADIN:\nA paladin is a warrior bold and pure, the exemplar of everything good and true. Like the fighter, the paladin is a man of combat. However, the paladin lives for the ideals of righteousness, justice, honesty, piety, and chivalry. He strives to be a living example of these virtues so that others might learn from him as well as gain by his actions.\nNOTE: Wisdom is the casting statistic for a paladin. It affects their maximum spellcasting level, spell saving throw DCs, and number of bonus spells.\nHit Points per Level: 1-10\nAdvantages:\n* Proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, heavy armor, and shields.\n* Paladins may use Lay On Hands 1/Day. Lay On Hands heals the target for a number of hit points equal to the paladin's Charisma modifier times their paladin level (minimum of 1 point per level). It can also be used on an undead creature to deal damage to them, though that would require a successful melee touch attack. Paladins gain an additional casting every 5 levels.\n* Paladins are immune to all forms of disease.\n* 2nd Level: Adds Charisma modifier to all saving throws.\n* 2nd Level: Spellcasting. Paladins gain the ability to cast spells.\n* 2nd level: Smite Evil. Once per day, the paladin may now attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. They add their Charisma modifier (if positive) to their attack roll and deal a number of extra d4s equal to their paladin level plus their Charisma modifier. Paladins can smite evil an additional time every 10 levels.\n* 2nd Level: Aura of Courage. Paladins become immune to fear, and allies within 10 feet receive a bonus of +4 to saving throws against fear effects.\n* 3rd level: Remove Disease. The paladin gains the ability to remove disease from other characters a number of times per day equal to their level divided by 3.\n* 3rd Level: Turn Undead. When this power is invoked, the paladin attempts to use the power of their patron deity to terrify a group of undead. The higher the paladin's level and charisma are, the greater their chance of success is. Though this ability is similar to the cleric's Turn Undead ability, the paladin's ability functions as though he or she were two levels lower than a cleric.\nDisadvantages\n* The paladin must be lawful good or neutral good in alignment and must choose a divine order. This choice of an order restricts the paladin's multiclassing possibilities.\n* The paladin must react to evil deeds that occur in their presence.",

Rangers gain the ability to cast spells.\n* 6th level: The ranger can take the Whirlwind Attack feat provided they meet the Dexterity requirement, ignoring all other requirements.\n* 6th level: Set Natural Snare. This ability sets a trap that, which triggered by an enemy, ensnares all enemies within 20 feet for 5 rounds on a failed Reflex save. The save DC is 6 plus the ranger's Wilderness Lore skill. The ranger gains an additional use of Set Natural Snare every 6 levels after 6.\n* 7th level: Woodland Stride. The ranger becomes immune to Entangle, Web, and Spike Growth.\n* 9th level: The ranger can take the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Manyshot feats, even if they don't meet the prerequisites.\n* 15th level: The ranger can take the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Manyshot feats a second time, which no other class can do.\nDisadvantages:\n* Rangers gain feats at a slower rate than fighters.\n* Rangers do not start with proficiency in heavy armor.",

Shortswords, throwing daggers, darts, shortbows, composite shortbows, light crossbows, slings, clubs and unarmed attacks deal an extra die of sneak attack damage.

From there, the essence must be filtered out by leeching the blood with mummy wrappings, distillation, and precipitation in a centrifuge, producing a sweet-smelling golden liquid... or, in the case of ichor from evil deities, a foul mixture of grease and coarse dust.\nConsuming the resulting substance is usually fatal; the purified ichor must be diluted and adapted to the user's system to have any positive effect. The exact method depends on the user, and requires intensive research and testing to discover. If the user is lucky, the method might be as harmless as crushing up some pearls and mixing the ichor with pumpkin juice and butter to produce an odd-flavored but perfectly drinkable potion.\nIf the user is unlucky, administering the dose might require vivisection.\nRegardless of the method, the final result is a violent twisting of the digestive tract and the spread of the ichor through the user's body. The process is immensely painful and draining, permanently lowering the user's Constitution by 1 and dealing 10d10 poison damage with a save vs. death at -4 for half damage.
