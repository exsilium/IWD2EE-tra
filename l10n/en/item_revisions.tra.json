On one of his fishing trips near Targos, his small boat capsized near the Maer Dualdon shore. He held onto his prize catch, an \"unbelievably massive\" knucklehead trout, despite being charged by a hungry bear when he reached shore. The bear snatched the majority of the trout away from Ned, leaving him holding the poor fish's tooth-severed head. Ned walked the rest of the way to Targos and kept the head as evidence of his encounter. Over time, Ned started to attribute his good fortune as a sailor to his \"lucky knucky\". The brigand Marg the Trembler \"won\" Ned's lucky knucky away from him in a rigged card game. Ned was bitter over being cheated, but he wasn't willing to stand up to Marg to get it back. Marg later used the fish head as currency to buy supplies as he hastily fled from Targos. The man who received the piece of bone held on to it for a few months before handing it off to a friend at the docks. In the years that followed up to the current date, Ned's \"lucky knucky\" has been traded, won, or sold to over a dozen people in Targos and, once, in Bremen.\nSTATISTICS:\nLuck: +1\nWeight: 0 lb.",

  "10173": "Few have heard of the (literally) short-lived underground movement against the Hosttower of the Arcane called the Circle of Ice - nor the rings that came to mark the members of the organization, both in life and in death. \nThe Circle of Ice was sponsored by a merchant from Waterdeep whose name has been burned from recorded history by the Hosttower. Apparently, after being forced to debase himself before the Hosttower during a trading agreement in Luskan (and being forced to surrender much of his cargo), the merchant became obsessed with wiping the Hosttower from the face of Faerun. Commissioning wizards in Waterdeep to fashion a score of rings for him, he set about using the last of his remaining wealth to hire a band of wizard slayers to bring about the downfall of the Hosttower. These twenty wizard slayers made arrangements to travel north on their own and rendezvous with the merchant in Luskan. \nIronically enough, the merchant never wore one of these rings, which was key in exposing and defeating the movement. As soon as he returned to Luskan, his mind was picked apart by telepaths and his movements scried, and each wizard slayer and accomplice was noted, identified, and ultimately led into deathtraps where their rings proved no match against the summoned monsters and arrows of slaying wielded by the ambush parties. It is rumored that only one wizard slayer, Martek, escaped the Hosttower, and to this day, he has never been found, which has been a constant source of irritation to the mages.\nIn any event, the Circle of Ice died a quick, silent death in Luskan, but the merchant lived on as a toy of the Hosttower, serving them until death, at which point, his corpse was stored in their laboratories. It is most likely his preserved body will end up as the left arm of a flesh golem named Bok many years from now. \nThese small bands of Cold Reflection appear to be made of crystallized ice, very cold to the touch, and they cannot be seen by a wizard unless the wizard knows they are there. \nIf your band contains one that fancies him or herself a wizard slayer, perhaps these rings may be used for the purpose they were intended... but without the shortsightedness of foolish merchants handicapping your efforts. \nSTATISTICS:\nSpell Resistance: Set to 20\nWeight: 0 lb.",

Once the other members of the Circle of Ice began to be murdered in Luskan after the Hosttower learned their identities, Martek used the power of his enhanced ring to shield himself from the scrying of the Hosttower wizards and escape southwards. He eventually returned the ring to his dwarven ally, who sold it to a merchant making his way for Bryn Shander. \nThis Cold Steel Reflection ring differs from the other Circle of Ice rings in that it seems to have a ring of steel beneath the icy exterior of the ring - much like Martek himself. \nSTATISTICS:\nSpecial:\n  Spell Resistance: Set to 32\n  Spell Power:  Can cast the 6th level Wizard Spell Globe of Invulnerability (at level 30) once per day\nWeight: 0 lb.",

But such mastery lies in staying focused upon your enemy even in the heat of battle... and these simple leather armbands are intended to do just that.\nInitially used to help in the training of students at the Kamjin-Doh, these Bands of Focus radiate a soft moonlight glow when the light of dusk falls upon them. While worn, they exert a slight calming influence on the mind of the sword saint that wields them, heightening the warrior's perceptions and senses, and allowing them to read the movements of their opponents easier. On the rare occasion when an enemy strikes a sword saint, these bands allow the wielder to shrug off pain (which in the teachings of Kamjin-Doh are called, \"distractions\") and keep the pain where it belongs - on one's opponent. \nMany of these bands were scattered throughout Faerun in the wake of the destruction of the Kamjin-Doh at the hands of the Master of Razors.

As the Master lost focus, his bands of focus corroded, almost to rot away as they were wrapped upon his bleeding arms. Nonetheless, these tattered bands still hold the power, strength, and viciousness of the Master of Razors... making the one who wields them far more deadly.\nIf you wear these bands, never forget their purpose, never forget your focus, and never forget the reach of your enemy.

Those unfortunate merchant ships that crossed paths with The Bouncing Rhonda were never able to outrun the cutter, were summarily boarded and their merchandise stolen. \nNow, the fact that Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard and his hearty men of The Bouncing Rhonda successfully pirated ships was not so unusual. No, the unusual part was that after the men of The Bouncing Rhonda successfully seized a merchant vessel, Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard would jump from the crow's nest, grab a rope in mid flight that was tied to the mast, gallantly swing down and land elegantly upon the deck of the merchant ship. At almost the same time Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard's feet touched the merchant ship's deck, the captured crew took an instant liking to the pirate captain. In fact, it was not uncommon for a majority of the captured crews to beg for a commission on The Bouncing Rhonda. However, the instant the pirate captain and his crew left the merchant ship (along with its cargo), the remaining merchant ship's crew immediately resumed their hatred for the pirate captain.\nNo one knew why or how Captain Aeryl Goldenbeard managed to charm his victims so well. That is, not until one day, while the good pirate captain was making one of his famous entrances via rope and mast, his colorful bandana flew off his near balding head. The second his foot touched the deck, all the former merchant crews that went along with the pirate ship instantly came to their senses and summarily beat the pirate captain to death. It did not take long for those around to realize that the pirate captain's bandana held magical properties that made him seem more charming. \nUnfortunately for the remaining pirate and merchant crew, the bandana flew into the sea. However, rumors would pop up from time to time that a particularly dashing swashbuckler had the uncanny ability to charm his way out of trouble and liked to swing from mast ropes - and that he wore a very colorful bandana.\nSTATISTICS:\nGeneric Armor Bonus: +3\nSpecial:\n Charisma: +6 bonus\n Spell Power: Can cast the spell Charm Person twice per day (Will DC 44)\nWeight: 1 lb.",

However, after helping others, she would quickly return to her solitary ways, despite the general tolerance exhibited by the locals in Neverwinter.\nOne special event that called for her ranger skills came and changed her life forever. An elderly female cleric of Eilistraee came to Maya and asked her aid in tracking down and destroying a demon that was tormenting her flock. Maya eagerly accepted the quest, put on her splint mail armor, secured her sword, and followed the cleric through the woods. After a day's travel, the cleric stopped at a small clearing between four towering trees. In the middle of the clearing was a small pond of water no wider than a yard. The cleric turned to Maya and said that the demon could be seen in the pond. Doubting, Maya approached the pond and peered in. The only thing Maya saw was her own reflection, and she stated that fact rather tersely to the cleric. The cleric smirked a bit and replied by saying that the demon was her reflection. In fact, the cleric pointed out that the demon was responsible for Maya's solitude and self-pity, and that the only one who was concerned about Maya's mixed breeding was Maya.\nMaya scoffed at the cleric, told her that she did not know what she was talking about, turned and started to head back in the direction they came.

The cleric bowed her head and replied that yes, she did die, but that she was granted the grace of Eilistaee to seek out Maya and aid her - aid her in destroying the demon of self-pity and solitude. The cleric then went on to say that Maya would never find sanctuary by alienating herself from the company of others, but that sanctuary comes from within. Once Maya could accept who she was, what she was, and the fact that there were many out in the world like her and who were willing to embrace her, then sanctuary would follow her, always.

It was during one of his foraging expeditions that he surprised a group of dwarven miners of the Brueghor Clan who were new to the region. Before Gohji could raise his hands to show he meant them no harm, an enchanted warhammer shattered his knee, causing him to plummet to the ground.

There are few creatures on the Lower Planes that would not hesitate to confront a holy warrior wielding such a weapon... and this one, perhaps more so than others. Once, it was nothing more than a simple iron sword, but through the courage and faith of one man, it became something more.\nThe blade of this holy avenger glows with a soft golden light. Inscribed upon the hilt in flowing gold letters is \"Cera Sumat,\" which translates into \"Six, now Silenced.\"  Cera Sumat earned its name through the labors of elderly duke Kholsa Ehld, a man cresting nearly eighty years of age, who vowed to complete a task that the greatest warriors of three kingdoms feared to do... all because of the weeping of a child. \nThe times in which Old Duke Ehld lived were ones of great upheaval, and the servitors of Bane were strong, crushing all that stood in their way. Entire kingdoms feared their wrath, and to speak out against them meant death, so many remained silent and turned their eyes from the evils of Bane and his servants. \nDuring these dark times, the most terrible of Bane's minions were six who called themselves the Lost Followers. Their souls were storms of avarice and hate, and mighty were the powers at their command. They reveled in strife and tyranny... and for all the blood they shed, it was never enough. \nTogether, the Lost Followers brought about the downfall of the Silver Court, slaying its king upon his throne and renaming his once-beautiful nation the Barbed Kingdom. After animating his decapitated corpse and having it march through the streets slaying anyone it could find, they brought a rain of fire down upon the city and the lands around, leaving it a barren wasteland. It is said that they dined in the capital's great hall that night as the land burned, and they raised their wine glasses as the screams of the dying reached their peak. \nThere was only one survivor. In their last act of malice, the Lost Followers left the king's only daughter, barely five years old, alive to reign as \"Queen\" over the burned kingdom. They called her the Weeping Queen and cast wards about her so that she might never leave the empty capital, and then left her to starve. Their appetite momentarily slaked, the Lost Followers parted ways and went upon their separate roads of damnation, sowing strife in the Bane's Name.\nOld Duke Ehld was the first one to cross the wards of the Barbed Kingdom and seek out the Weeping Queen upon her father's throne. When he found the small girl, he approached, kneeled before her, and told her he had come to pledge his life in her service. In stiff, formal words, he said he had brought food and water and apologized for his lateness, but his bones were old and it had taken him some time to reach this place. The near-starving child stared at him as he pledged his worn blade and his honor to seeing that the ones who had done this terrible crime answered for their actions, if his Queen wished it. After a long, stunned silence, the Weeping Queen found the words to thank him.\nFrom the moment Ehld left the throne room in search of the Lost Followers, the weeping of the queen ended, and she never wept again. \nOver six years, Ehld traveled the lands of Faerun and across the planes themselves, seeking the Six, and asking them to answer for their crimes. Each scoffed at the old man and his worn-looking blade, only to find him a dangerous opponent... and in the end, the victor. He recorded the events of their death upon a stone set into the pommel of his blade, and there was even regret in his writings that he had not been able to enlighten the Lost Followers to turn from their path before it came to its end.\nWhen the last of the Six had answered for their crimes upon the edge of the Cera Sumat blade, Ehld returned to the Weeping Queen and laid the blade at her feet. Where once it had been a tarnished blade, it shone as brightly as the sun, and the stone in the pommel was covered with the writing of his journeys. He detached the stone, and set into a chain, and he gave it to the Weeping Queen. Ehld told her to keep the chain to wear as a reminder of the many evils of the world and that they are never far from one's heart... but if one's heart is true and one's path is righteous, one may triumph against any number of evils.\nDuke Ehld outlived his queen, living to the age of 107, at which point Ehld took his Cera Sumat and left the Barbed Kingdom... and is said to have traveled north. In time, the Barbed Kingdom rose to its former glory and its name was changed, and with it, the fate of Cera Sumat and the Medallion of the Lost Followers was forgotten... until your arrival in Kuldahar and the medallion and the Holy Avenger were united once again to meet the Lost Followers in battle one final time. \nBut the story of Ehld and Cera Sumat was a story of another time, and of the adventures of another hero.

  "11020": "The saga of Wandering Sky is a tale of hearth and home told by many skalds of the North. The tale exemplifies the persistence and strength of the barbarian spirit.\nWhen the legions of Arakon the Arch-Mage swept across Icewind Dale, the Tribe of the Bear was among the first of the tribes to meet his assault. Overwhelmed by the superior forces, the barbarians fought bravely, but they were no match for Arakon's forces. One of the tribe's eldest hunters and warriors, Hreidgar, was knocked unconscious during the battle, and he awoke to the sky tearing at his face and the remains of his fellows around him. Of his wife and children, there was no trace, and without a word, Hreidgar took up his great sword and followed the path of Arakon's army, determined to reclaim them and avenge the fallen. \nHreidgar was among the first to pledge his blade to the barbarian shaman Jerrod when he united the tribes against Arakon, and he served tirelessly in the great battles ahead, even on the darkest day when Arakon unleashed armies of the hells against Jerrod and the tribes. In every battle, Hreidgar and his greatsword were as one, howling like the wind as he drove his enemies back... and to their deaths. But when Arakon was at last defeated, no trace of Hreidgar's wife and child were to be found. \nHreidgar continued his search, and his journey of many years is said to have taken him across the great cliffs of the Reghed Glacier during the Season of Raining Spears, upon the Sea of Moving Ice where he sailed with the Tribe of the Great Whale and fought slavers from the south, and then to his final destination, the small town of Enholm's Point, where he stood with the handful of the town's defenders against the army of Kresselack the Black Wolf. It is said Hreidgar fought so fiercely that Kresselack conceded the field in honor of the warrior - but not before striking the fatal blow that would end the warrior's life.\nBleeding from numerous wounds, Hreidgar is said to have wandered north from Enholm's Point, traveling for many miles before collapsing to his knees. With the last of his strength, the old warrior plunged his blade into the ice and said he had finally found what he had been seeking. \"Let the sky wander,\" he proclaimed, \"for my travels are done.\"  \nWhen the townsfolk of Enholm's Point returned the next day to carry his body away, they found Hreidgar, but his blade had vanished. It is said that the blade now wanders as the sky wanders, finding its way to others with long journeys before them... and guiding them to their final destination, whatever it may be. \nSTATISTICS:\nDamage: 2d6 + 1\nAttack Bonus:  +1 \nEnchantment:  +1\nDamage Type:  Slashing\nSpecial: \n  Doom: 20% chance per hit to cast Doom on target\nWeight:  12 lb.\nFeat Requirement:  Martial Weapon, Great Sword\nType:  Two-handed",

Dullcobble, realizing he had to back his proud words, agreed heartily... but inside, he was struck with fear that he would fail the test.\nDullcobble made several attempts to fashion a chopping axe, most of them ending up as cordwood next to his fireplace. In the day before his challenge was to be called due, his only surviving weapon was a lop-sided axe whose haft was widely overbalanced. Realizing that displaying such a weapon would make him the laughing stock of the community, Dullcobble hired a wild mage to take his misshapen axe and turn it into a serviceable weapon. The mage shrugged, took his payment, and promised the axe to Dullcobble on the dawn of the next day. When Dullcobble woke up in the morning, the misshapen axe lay on his doorstep, unchanged, and he had no choice but to take the axe to his challengers... and take his chances. \nWhen Dullcobble brought it into the town's meeting hall, the axe's appearance was greeted with derision and laughter. Dullcobble, his face burning, became so angry he threw it at his tormenters - and watched as the haft traveled over the blade's head to smash into a pillar and shatter it, causing the roof to collapse. Dullcobble, slack-jawed with surprise, was knocked unconscious by a falling timber, but the other challengers made it outside without injury.\nDullcobble's blow to the head was a serious one, and it turned him into the village idiot - not much of a change from his previous lifestyle. The axe itself was tossed upon a merchant cart headed north, and it was never seen again. Whatever the enchantments the wild mage scrawled on the axe did, it causes the haft to be the first to strike an opponent, doing crushing damage instead of slashing damage. \nSTATISTICS:\nDamage:  1d6 + 4\nAttack Bonus:  +4\nEnchantment:  +4\nDamage Type:  Melee (bludgeoning)\nDamage Type:  Missile (bludgeoning)\nSpecial:\n  Returning: Returns to wielder\nWeight: 3 lb.\nRequired Feat:  Martial Weapon, Axe\nType:  One-handed",

  "11332": "The gargantuan throwing axe known as Big Death is an orcish weapon through and through. Carried to the final battle of the Hand of Seldarine by the hulking orc warlord Yellow-Toothed Grubrun Foul-Tusks, Big Death had its origins in an ogre mercenary's two-handed battle-axe. After a particular vicious raid on a dwarven mining settlement, Grubrun spied the axe lodged in the skull of a dead dwarven marshal. It seems that an ogre mercenary had impaled himself upon the marshal's spear in a careless charge, but his last act had been to nearly cleave his killer's head in twain and, in trying to wrench the axe free for a second blow, shattering the haft before expiring in a bloody heap.\nPrying the huge, black cold-iron blade from the base of the dwarf's skull, Grubrun returned to his fortress at Nab-Nurog and had his shaman set to enchanting it. Not having considered fixing the shaft and finding it too heavy and awkward to use in melee, Grubrun deigned to use the weapon as a throwing axe and demanded that it be ensorcelled to return to his hands after being hurled. The warlord found great delight in heaving the enormous weapon about, roaring with glee as Big Death came careening back to him, gleaming and gore-spattered, after lopping some poor enemy in two at the waist.\nGrubrun Foul-Tusks finally met his end at the final battle of the Hand where he threw Big Death at the elven weapon master Kaylessa; she deftly sidestepped the flying weapon, darted forward, and ran her own blade through the empty-handed orc's belly.

  "11334": "The gargantuan throwing axe known as Big Black Flying-Death is an orcish weapon through and through. Carried to the final battle of the Hand of Seldarine by the hulking orc warlord Yellow-Toothed Grubrun Foul-Tusks, Big Black Flying-Death had its origins in an ogre mercenary's two-handed battle-axe. After a particular vicious raid on a dwarven mining settlement, Grubrun spied the axe lodged in the skull of a dead dwarven marshal. It seems that an ogre mercenary had impaled himself upon the marshal's spear in a careless charge, but his last act had been to nearly cleave his killer's head in twain and, in trying to wrench the axe free for a second blow, shattering the haft before expiring in a bloody heap.\nPrying the huge, black cold-iron blade from the base of the dwarf's skull, Grubrun returned to his fortress at Nab-Nurog and had his shaman set to enchanting it. Not having considered fixing the shaft and finding it too heavy and awkward to use in melee, Grubrun deigned to use the weapon as a throwing axe and demanded that it be ensorcelled to return to his hands after being hurled. The warlord found great delight in heaving the enormous weapon about, roaring with glee as Big Black Flying-Death came careening back to him, gleaming and gore-spattered, after lopping some poor enemy in two at the waist.\nGrubrun Foul-Tusks finally met his end at the final battle of the Hand where he threw Big Black Flying-Death at the elven weapon master Kaylessa; she deftly sidestepped the flying weapon, darted forward, and ran her own blade through the empty-handed orc's belly.

According to the tale, the bow takes its name from its pivotal role in the escape of a young woman named Sophia, a typical maiden fair who was pledged to marry the son of Duke Hugh Gladegrin (the son is described as hideously ugly and of foul temperament, of course). Sophia, however, believed she was destined to marry one of the Duke's archers, a dashing young golden-haired fellow who roamed the surrounding lands felling foul beasts with a single twang of his mighty bow. As the tale goes, one of the court wizards (a transmuter) took pity on the young woman's plight and cast a spell that turned her into an arrow for an hour's time. The transmuter arranged for Sophia to be fired from the castle wall to a ship waiting off the coast, where she could sail to freedom.\nThe tale then breaks down from here, as numerous accounts claim that Sophia did not flee the coast safely, and that she transformed back into her normal body while she was halfway across the water, plunging into the icy ocean. Another school claims that, while in arrow form, Sophia pierced the side of the ship, then choked to death when she resumed her normal form with her neck embedded in the ship's hull. Still others claim that she was never even launched from the bow, and that she resumed her normal form while inside the archer's quiver, and she awoke, naked, wearing only the small band of leather about her body. When this last argument is made, the discussion generally deteriorates into a steady stream of sexual innuendos and the evening officially goes downhill.\nWhatever the tale, the bow has a range unmatched by many other bows in the realms, and the arrows launched from it strike far and true - unlike the story surrounding the bow.\nSTATISTICS:\nDamage:  +3 (missile)\nAttack Bonus:  +4\nSpecial: Half again the range of a normal bow.\nWeight: 3 lb.\nFeat Requirement:  Martial Weapon, Bow\nType:  Two-handed",

Still others claim that she was never even launched from the bow, and that she resumed her normal form while inside the archer's quiver, and she awoke, naked, wearing only the small band of leather about her body. When this last argument is made, the discussion generally deteriorates into a steady stream of sexual innuendos and the evening officially goes downhill.\nWhatever the tale, the bow has a range unmatched by many other bows in the realms, and the arrows launched from it strike far and true - unlike the story surrounding the bow.\nSTATISTICS:\nDamage:  +6 (missile)\nAttack Bonus:  +8\nSpecial: Half again the range of a normal bow.\nWeight: 3 lb.\nFeat Requirement:  Martial Weapon, Bow\nType:  Two-handed",

Many tragedies have occurred around these two items, and many are the deaths they caused although no arrow was ever shot from them. \nAt the height of the dwarven-elvish alliance in the North, a disagreement arose between the two races over the matter of trading enchanted weapons to the men of the south, who were beginning to establish a foothold in the North. The dwarves were of the opinion that the many great works that had been built through the joint efforts of the dwarves and elves should be offered up to man and the profits used to fill the coffers of both races. This suggestion was not well-received by the elves nor by their leader, the arch-mage Larrel, and the matter was quickly dropped. \nHowever, when the Arc of Gold, one of the items fashioned jointly by dwarven and elven weaponsmiths was found in the hands of an orcish war party not long after the debate in the alliance councils, the elves accused the dwarves of selling the weapons to the goblinoids out of greed. The dwarves, insulted, broke the shafts of their hammers in the middle of the council and broke talks with the elves, returning to their halls in Dorn's Deep and never speaking to them again. The two races, now divided, were soon swallowed by the Dark Horde that was devouring the North beneath its banner. \nAt the time of the fall of the Severed Hand, the Arc of Gold was mounted within the halls of Severed Hand as a reminder of the dwarven treachery and dwarven greed. When the Severed Hand fell, the Arc of Gold silently watched as the goblinoids tore apart the elvish defenders and laid waste to tower after tower, until the elvish archmage Larrel, in a desperate measure, brought about the Mythal cataclysm that sealed the fate of the Severed Hand once and for all. \nWhen the Mythal was cast, the Arc of Gold vanished from the halls of the Severed Hand and has not been seen since... until now. \nSTATISTICS:\nDamage:  +6 (missile)\nAttack Bonus:  +5\nSpecial:\n  Composite: Gains Strength bonus to damage, up to a maximum of +15\nWeight: 9 lb.\nFeat Requirement:  Martial Weapon, Bow\nType:  Two-handed\nMinimum Dexterity of 18 Required",

Many tragedies have occurred around these two items, and many are the deaths they caused although no arrow was ever shot from them. \nThe Mithral Arc was developed at the height of the dwarven-elvish alliance, and it was one of the many joint items developed by the dwarves and elves of the Severed Hand before the destruction of the Severed Hand and the Fall of Dorn's Deep. Its accuracy was unparalleled, and the dwarves presented it to the elves as a token of goodwill between the races. The string of the bow was said to have been blessed by the elvish archmage Larrel himself, with a range that seemed to rival the horizon. It was mounted in the halls of Severed Hand so that all visitors could see it, and see the achievements the dwarves and elves united could bring about.\nWhen its brother, the Arc of Gold, was discovered in the hands of a band of orcs raiding in the forests north of Severed Hand, the elves became furious and accused the dwarves of selling the relics the two races had jointly crafted to their enemies. The dwarves, enraged by the insult, seized the Mithral Arc and returned to Dorn's Deep, cutting off all contact with the elves. \nIt is said that at the moment the alliance disbanded, the string of the Mithral Arc broke with a final twang, and the bow, useless, remained deep within Lower Dorn's Deep, silently watching as the dwarves were slowly driven deeper and deeper into the Deep by the encroaching goblinoid hordes that had begun to swarm down from the North. It was never seen and never taken by the Dark Horde that marched through Dorn's Deep, and the Mithral Arc remained there for countless years in the darkness with the dwarven dead piled around it, still clutching their weapons. \nHow it came to be here is unknown, but the string of the Mithral Arc is restored and the bow is eager to be used. Perhaps there is hope for the fallen elves and dwarves still... or at least the opportunity to reclaim their once-proud homeland from the half-breed hordes that threaten it. \nSTATISTICS:\nDamage:  +11 (missile)\nAttack Bonus:  +10\nSpecial:\n  Composite: Gains Strength bonus to damage, up to a maximum of +15\nWeight: 1 lb.\nFeat Requirement:  Martial Weapon, Bow\nType:  Two-handed\nMinimum Dexterity of 18 Required",

One of the travelers he met was an elven musician named Relev Thinriver. Relev introduced Nikolai to the violin and taught him for several years as he wandered through the area. Relev knew that Nikolai was an incredibly gifted child, with quick fingers, a keen mind, and a passion for all things in the world. Relev also recognized that Nikolai was exceedingly proud and arrogant. In spite of Nikolai's shortcomings, Relev taught him everything he knew.\nAfter Relev was killed by a band of orcs, Nikolai began to practice on his own throughout the Vast. Despite his travels, he always returned to the isolate peaks of his mountain birthplace. He became famed throughout the Vast, the southern Moonsea and Sembia for his incredible talent and passionate performances. Eventually, news of the proud young virtuoso spread to the ears of a nearby thug from Calaunt named Tremble Ghon.

After the residents fled, Craum squatted his old bones down upon the blackened buildings, grumbling to himself and snorting flames from his nostrils. \nA few hours and several miles away, the residents of Hornhollow finally decided that someone must go negotiate with the dragon and see what it wanted. When no volunteers were forthcoming, a lottery was conducted - and the loser, a traveling ministrel, Aznee Fraystrings, was given the dangerous task of attempting to deal with the dragon. Aznee had lived out his welcome in the camp many nights previous, and the loggers considered it no great loss if Aznee gained a new home in the dragon's belly.\nAznee, somewhat absent-minded but of a brave heart, stumbled his way into the camp, and finally mustered the courage to speak with the dragon. During the (now-famous) exchange that followed, Aznee discovered that Craum, who was somewhat far along in dragon years and in none too good health, was suffering the draconic equivalent of a bad cough, and his hacking and wheezing masked his plaintive attempts to try and find someone, anyone, who could help cure his fits of coughing. \nSeeing a solution, Aznee offered a cure that helped an elderly uncle of his - a sprig of Maiden's Milk flower, that when crushed and administered in a tea, helped quell coughing in a matter of minutes. Some could undoubtably be found in the forest nearby, Aznee exclaimed, and he set about gathering up several sprigs and preparing them for the dragon. After lumping them into a great pot, he administered the steaming cauldron to the dragon.\nIt is suspected that either Craug drank the mixture too fast, or else Aznee had mistaken Bellows Root for Maiden's Milk, but whatever the reason, Craug vomited the mixture back out a few seconds later, setting fire to several acres of the wood and torching poor Aznee where he stood. After this vomitus belch, Craug ran wild for almost an hour, trying to spit out the remainder of the concoction. At the end of his rampage, the venerable red dragon fell over dead, the sudden flurry of activity more than his old bones could stand. \nWhen the loggers came to break down the dragon a day later, they discovered that Craum's bones still carried echoes of his coughing fits, and his entire skeleton creaked and wheezed, even after death. They struck a deal with a local mage, who bought the dragon's bones and fashioned a series of musical instruments with them, dubbed the \"Pipes of the Wheezing Dragon.\"  These yellow bone pipes are famous throughout the Realms and, when used by a bard, they can be used to spit bursts of flames at opponents.

  "12202": "The Heart of Winter is often confused with the legendary Heartstone Gem, a powerful scrying artifact that serves as the heart of the great tree community of Kuldahar. The Heart of Winter is not an object, but an expression frequently used by the Uthgart tribes of the north to refer to a warrior or creature that has rid itself of all except one driving focus - usually revenge or hatred. The expression is often used to describe the barbarian lord, Wylfdene, who returned to lead the barbarian tribes in a campaign against the Ten-Towns in the Year of the Cold Soul (1281 Dale Reckoning). According to legend, Wylfdene claimed to be the reincarnation of the shaman Jerrod, one of the barbarians greatest heroes and the one who sacrificed himself in the final battle against the archmage Arakon many hundreds of years ago. Claiming that his body had become home to Jerrod's spirit, Wylfdene rallied the tribes of the North to war to retake the lands that he claimed had been seized by the southerners of the Ten-Towns. Establishing a great war camp in Bremen's Run, a narrow canyon under the shadow of Kelvin's Cairn, he fought several quick battles against the dwarves and townsfolk of the region until a small band of adventurers arrived in the town of Lonelywood to try to carve out a peace between the Ten-Towns and the barbarians. Their efforts at diplomacy are said to have failed, but they succeeded in defeating Wylfdene and saving the Ten-Towns from destruction. It is believed that these adventurers are the only reason the Ten-Towns exist (and thrive) to this day.\nWhat happened to these brave adventurers is unknown. The last known record of them is a sighting of them at the Whistling Gallows Inn in Lonelywood, where they spoke with a halfling traveler who claimed to know of a place where great riches could be found. Shortly after this, the adventurers and the halfling vanished and were never heard from again. \nAfter reading the closing chapter of the book above, you notice that the top letter in each of the chapters weave together to form a peculiar summoning spell.

Meeting in the Winter's Cradle Tavern, this band of southerners had traveled north in search of adventure, and they were the first to join Hrothgar's expedition to investigate the rumor of troubles brewing in the great tree town of Kuldahar to the North, where a mighty oak, towering hundreds of feet high, sheltered a small town beneath its boughs with a life-giving warmth.\nThe misfortunes plaguing Icewind Dale led to the ambush of Hrothgar's expedition in the windswept Kuldahar Pass... and it left them the only survivors. Pressing on against goblinoid raiders that filled the Pass, the small band finally reached Kuldahar, only to discover the great tree was being threatened by an unknown evil deep within the mountains - if this evil was not stopped, Kuldahar would be destroyed, and the North itself might soon share the town's fate. \nThe brave band of adventurers searched out this evil, their travels carrying them from the crypts of the Vale of Shadows through the numerous ruins of the North, including the decaying elven fortress of the Severed Hand and the lava-filled caverns of Dragon's Eye. Much of their journey has been lost, but there is no doubt that their efforts led to the salvation of Kuldahar and the Ten-Towns and their deeds are still spoken of in Easthaven and Kuldahar to this day. Hrothgar himself has been laid to rest in a small glen near the town of Kuldahar, in memory of his selflessness in coming to the aid of his neighbor in a time when Easthaven itself was suffering troubles of its own. \nAmong their other acts of heroism, the adventurers are credited with the discovery of the location of the tomb of Kresselack the Black Wolf, one of the most infamous of the Northern generals, the discovery of the Severed Hand, and numerous other monasteries and ruins believed lost to time and the snows of the North.\nAfter reading the closing chapter of the book above, you notice that the top letter in each of the chapters weave together to form a peculiar summoning spell.
